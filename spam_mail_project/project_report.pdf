Title:

*Spam Mail Detection Using Machine Learning

Objective:

*To build a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using text-based features.

Dataset:

*SMS Spam Collection Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains 5,574 SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

Methodology:

1.Load the dataset

2.reprocess text (lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords)

3.Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF

4.Split data into training and testing sets

5.Train a Naive Bayes classifier

6.Evaluate the model using accuracy and F1-score

7.Test the model with new SMS messages

Algorithm Used:

*Multinomial Naive Bayes

Evaluation Metrics:

*Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Result:

*The model achieved approximately 97% accuracy and successfully classified spam and ham messages.

Conclusion:

*The spam detection system efficiently identifies unwanted messages and can be used in real-world applications such as email and SMS filtering.
